# Loan Approval Predictor

Predict whether a loan application will be approved using machine learning, with an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time insights.

---

##  Overview

This project builds a robust loan approval prediction pipeline utilizing:
- **Data preprocessing:** outlier removal, encoding, scaling  
- **Modeling:** Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM with Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning  
- **Ensembling:** Stacking and voting methods  
- **Deployment:** Interactive user interface via Streamlit with saved model artifacts for production use
